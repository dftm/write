# Using Docker

## What is Docker?

Docker is an open-source containerization platform that allows you to create, deploy, and run applications in containers. Containers allow you to package an application with all of its dependencies and ship it as a single unit, making it easy to deploy and run the application in any environment.

## Prerequisites

* To use Docker, you will need to install Docker on your machine. You can download the Docker installer from the Docker website ([https://www.docker.com/](https://www.docker.com/)).
* You will also need a text editor to write your Dockerfiles and a terminal to run the commands.

## Getting Started

To get started with Docker, you will need to create a Dockerfile and a docker-compose.yml file.

* A Dockerfile is a text file that contains the instructions for building a Docker image.
* A docker-compose.yml file is a YAML file that defines the services that make up your application and how they should be built, deployed, and scaled.

## Writing a Dockerfile

To write a Dockerfile, you will need to specify the base image that you want to use for your application. You can use an official image from the Docker Hub ([https://hub.docker.com/](https://hub.docker.com/)) or you can create your own base image.

Here is an example of a Dockerfile that uses the official Node.js image as the base image:

```docker
FROM node:12-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json .
COPY package-lock.json .
RUN npm install
COPY . .
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

This Dockerfile specifies the following instructions:

* `FROM`: Specifies the base image that the Docker image will be built on top of. In this case, the base image is the official Node.js image with version 12 and the Alpine Linux distribution.
* `WORKDIR`: Sets the working directory for the application.
* `COPY`: Copies the specified files from the host machine to the Docker image.
* `RUN`: Runs the specified command in the Docker image. In this case, it runs `npm install` to install the dependencies for the application.
* `CMD`: Specifies the command that will be run when the Docker container is started. In this case, it runs `npm start` to start the application.

## Building a Docker Image

To build a Docker image from a Dockerfile, you will need to use the `docker build` command.

Here is the syntax for the `docker build` command:

```docker
docker build [OPTIONS] PATH
```

For example, to build a Docker image from the Dockerfile in the current directory, you can use the following command:

<pre class="language-docker"><code class="lang-docker"><strong>docker build .
</strong></code></pre>

This command will build a Docker image using the instructions in the Dockerfile and give it a unique ID.

## Running a Docker Container

To run a Docker container from a Docker image, you will need to use the `docker run` command.

Here is the syntax for the `docker run` command:

```docker
docker run [OPTIONS] IMAGE [COMMAND] [ARG...]
```

For example, to run a Docker container from the Docker image that you built in the previous step,&#x20;

you can use the following command:

```docker
docker run IMAGE
```

Replace `IMAGE` with the ID or name of the Docker image that you want to run.

By default, the `docker run` command will create a new container from the image and start the application. You can also use the `-d` flag to run the container in detached mode, which means that the container will run in the background and the command prompt will return immediately.

For example:

```docker
docker run -d IMAGE
```

## Viewing Running Containers

To view the containers that are currently running on your machine, you can use the `docker ps` command.

Here is the syntax for the `docker ps` command:

```docker
docker ps [OPTIONS]
```

For example, to view all running containers, you can use the following command:

```docker
docker ps
```

To view all containers (running and stopped), you can use the `-a` flag:

```docker
docker ps -a
```

## Stopping a Container

To stop a running Docker container, you can use the `docker stop` command.

Here is the syntax for the `docker stop` command:

<pre class="language-docker"><code class="lang-docker"><strong>docker stop CONTAINER
</strong></code></pre>

Replace `CONTAINER` with the ID or name of the container that you want to stop.

For example:

```docker
docker stop CONTAINER
```

## Removing a Container

To remove a Docker container, you can use the `docker rm` command.

Here is the syntax for the `docker rm` command:

```docker
docker rm CONTAINER
```

Replace `CONTAINER` with the ID or name of the container that you want to remove.

For example:

```docker
docker rm CONTAINER
```

## Using docker-compose

In addition to using the `docker` commands to build and run containers, you can also use `docker-compose` to simplify the process.

`docker-compose` is a tool that allows you to define the services that make up your application in a `docker-compose.yml` file and then run them with a single command.

Here is an example `docker-compose.yml` file for a simple Node.js application:

```docker
version: "3"
services:
  app:
    build: .
    command: npm start
    volumes:
      - .:/app
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
```

This file defines a single service, `app`, which is built from the `Dockerfile` in the current directory and runs the `npm start` command. It also mounts the current directory as a volume in the container and exposes port 3000.

To build and run the services defined in a `docker-compose.yml` file, you can use the `docker-compose up` command.

Here is the syntax for the `docker-compose up` command:

<pre class="language-docker"><code class="lang-docker"><strong>docker-compose up [OPTIONS] [SERVICE...]
</strong></code></pre>

For example, to build and run the `app` service defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file above, you can use the following command:

```docker
docker-compose up
```

This command will build the `app` service and run it in a container.

To stop the services and remove the containers, you can use the `docker-compose down` command.

Here is the syntax for the `docker-compose down` command:

```docker
docker-compose down [OPTIONS] [SERVICE...]
```

For example:

```docker
docker-compose down
```

This command will stop the `app` service and remove the container.
