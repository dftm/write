# Using GitHub

GitHub is a popular web-based version control platform that allows developers to collaborate on projects, track changes to code, and roll back updates if necessary. It is widely used in the tech industry and has a variety of features that make it an essential tool for developers.

## Getting Started

To get started with GitHub, you will need to create a free account on their website. Once you have done this, you can create a new repository (or "repo") to store your code. A repo is a collection of files that are related to a specific project, and it is stored on GitHub's servers.

## Adding Files and Collaborating

Once you have created a repo, you can begin adding files to it. You can do this either by uploading existing files from your computer, or by creating new files directly on the GitHub website. You can also invite other developers to collaborate on your repo, which is useful if you are working on a team project.

## Tracking Changes with Commits

One of the key features of GitHub is the ability to track changes to your code over time. This is done using a system called "commits." A commit is a snapshot of your code at a specific point in time, and it allows you to roll back to previous versions if necessary. To make a commit, you will need to add a message describing the changes you have made. This message should be brief but informative, as it will help you (and any collaborators) understand the changes that have been made.

## Experimenting with Branches

Another useful feature of GitHub is the ability to create "branches." A branch is a copy of your code that you can use to experiment with new features or make changes without affecting the main version of your code. This is useful if you want to try out a new idea but aren't sure if it will work, as you can always switch back to the main branch if things don't go as planned.

## Conclusion

Overall, GitHub is an essential tool for developers that allows them to collaborate on projects, track changes to their code, and experiment with new ideas. Whether you are working on a small personal project or a large team project, GitHub has the features you need to make the most of your coding efforts.
