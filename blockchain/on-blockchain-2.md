# A discussion on blockchain part 2

1\. What is a question you most often ask in relation to cryptocurrencies?

**Lambo when?**

That Is the first thing that springs to mind if you have been around the Cryptocurrency space and through the Great Crypto Crash that caused widespread investor panic, while the sirens of the mainstream media touted the end of the cryptocurrency “bubble”.

But (almost) everyone survived - and from winter comes spring, so here we are, today.

The serious question though, that I do ask everyone involved in the FinTech space now and again is **what do they envision the world of P2P bank-less economy to be.**

And that is a question evoking as many answers as the multitude of people answering it - filtered by their political stance, their financial background and their whole outlook on life.

2\. How difficult is it to find an answer to that question?

As said above, there is not a singular answer to this question and a singular truth to be paired with it.

But in reality, what exists is shared aspirations in transforming one of the elemental building blocks of society, the sum of financial interactions in a set market by means of currency.

While the definite future is still being shaped by means of institutions weighing in on the subject and subsequent regulations being introduced, the answer is still pending and daily research on news and updates of the whole Crypto Space are mandatory.

3\. Why are you interested in cryptocurrencies and/or blockchain?

**Blockchain** has millions of potential applications and is revolutionizing the way we have been handling problem-solving to this day.

As smart contracts, multiple uses of the trust-less system have been suggested and are being researched.

And while the most obvious has been that of cryptocurrencies and monetary transactions to the point of replacing the whole banking system as we know it today, there are still significant domains waiting to be disrupted

Arguably, the most crucial is **casting votes**, in relation to any current democratic decision making. Disrupting this should be carried out in ways that it can make it more direct, inclusive and just.

Other applications will be in **medical records, government documents, real estate**, and any transactions that now require any form of paperwork being signed and exchanged.

So, internet 1.0 and 2.0 might have been the initial lizard brain of the **human hive-mind**, but blockchains are the first advanced neurons that formed - maybe that sounds a bit too groupie-esque but as the great Donald said ‘It is what it is’.
