# The doc center

This will be the place where documentation will be kept and maintained.&#x20;

Docs are developed in Markdown and maintained in GitHub, while GitBook creates a presentation layer for ease of navigation.

Here, you will find all of the documentation and resources you need to effectively use and contribute to our project. We are constantly updating and improving our documentation, so be sure to check back often for the latest information.&#x20;

If you have any questions or suggestions, don't hesitate to reach out to us. We are always happy to help. Thank you for choosing to join us on this journey, and we hope you find everything you need to succeed.
